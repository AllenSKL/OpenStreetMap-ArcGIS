##Data
The Natural Earth bathymetry and the OSM land polygon shapefiles are available for download:
- The bathymetry layers utilise the Natural Earth bathymetry data available at [naturalearthdata.com](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-bathymetry). Select download all and unzip.
- The dissolved land polygon layer utilises pre-processed OSM available at [openstreetmap.com](http://openstreetmapdata.com/data/land-polygons). Select the download for: Format: Shapefile, Projection: WGS84. (Large polygons not split)

**Alternatively:**

To make the process easier the dissolved land polygon and bathymetry data have been combined into a file geodatabase that can then have the OSM data loaded into it: [download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wnuhvzh54rmey80/OpenStreetMap.gdb.zip?dl=0). _**Note:**_ *The data in this file geodatabase may not be up to date. To ensure the most up to date data, please see the websites below, download the latest version(s) and amend the file geodatabase as required.*
