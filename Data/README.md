##Data
To make the process easier the dissolved land polygon and bathymetry data have been combined into a file geodatabase that can then have the OSM data loaded into it.

The Natural Earth bathymetry shapefiles and the OSM land polygons are available for download if desired:
- The bathymetry layers utilise the Natural Earth bathymetry data available at [naturalearthdata.com](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-bathymetry). Select download all and unzip.
- The dissolved land polygon layer utilises pre-processed OSM available at [openstreetmap.com](http://openstreetmapdata.com/data/land-polygons). Select the download for: Format: Shapefile, Projection: WGS84. (Large polygons not split)
