##Resources

###Workflows
Two workflows for downloading, processing and displaying OSM data in ArcMap: 

1. [WORKFLOW-EXTENDED.md](https://github.com/GASCUK/OpenStreetMap-ArcGIS/blob/master/Resources/WORKFLOW-EXTENDED.md) gives detailed information on each stage of the process and the extact parameters and inputs required to achieve the desired results.
2. [WORKFLOW-SIMPLIFIED.md](https://github.com/GASCUK/OpenStreetMap-ArcGIS/blob/master/Resources/WORKFLOW-SIMPLIFIED.md) provides information on how to use [models](https://github.com/GASCUK/OpenStreetMap-ArcGIS/tree/master/Models) to achieve the same results as the extended workflow whilst making the process easier for the user. The models remove the requirement for the user to manually enter some of the parameters, such as the tags to add to the schema, speeding up the process and removing some of the chance for user error. 

###Troubleshooting

[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](https://github.com/GASCUK/OpenStreetMap-ArcGIS/blob/master/Resources/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) provides information on any issues that can occur when following the processes detailed in the workflows and the solutions required to resolve or work around them.
