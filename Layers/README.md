##Layer files

The zip file contains a series of template layer files at a range of zoom levels with symbology based on the OSM Humanitarian CartoCSS style.

The layers are designed to be used with data loaded using the ArcGIS OpenStreetMap Editor tools.

There are a number of definition queries the features within the layers and in order to speed up drawing it is recommended to build an attribute index for each of the tags.

Additional to raw OSM data, bathymetry and land data is also required to use these layers. Please see the [data](https://github.com/GASCUK/OpenStreetMap-ArcGIS/tree/master/Data) section for more information and to download the required files.
