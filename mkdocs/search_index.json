The style design is based on the \n\nOpenStreetMap\n humanitarian theme. The original style information can be \nfound at \nHDM-CartoCSS\n and is derived from \n\nCartoCSS\n.\n\n\nWorkflows\n\n\nThe two workflows walk the user through the process of loading, processing and displaying OSM data in ArcGIS Desktop. \nThere are two workflows that can be used:\n\n\n\n\nSimplified: A simplified version of the workflow that enables the user to run the process with minimal input using the \ncomplete OSM load model. The Complete OSM Load model pulls the individual models included in the toolbox together into one \nprocess. The user selects the input raw OSM data, output file geodatabase, whether a network dataset needs to be \ncreated and, if so, the network configuration file to be used. \n\n\nExtended: A more detailed version of the workflow that takes the user through the entire process step by step using the \nindividual models included in the toolbox.\n\n\n\n\nToolbox\n\n\nThe toolbox contains a number of models required to load and process the raw OSM data, enabling it to be displayed \ncorrectly in ArcMap. The toolbox is broken down into the individual models for those who wish to process the data \nin stages, or a complete model that pulls the individual models together, allowing the user to run the process from start \nto finish without monitoring.\n\n\nStyles\n\n\nThe stylesheet contains symbols for four distinct scale levels. Each zoom level groups one or more of \nthe display levels from OpenStreetMap:\n\n\n\n\nDisplay levels 0-10\n\n\nDisplay levels 11-12\n\n\nDisplay levels 13-15\n\n\nDisplay levels 16-19\n\n\n\n\nLayers\n\n\nThere are 19 OSM feature layer files included in the repository; one for each of the zoom levels. \nEach layer file contains the specific points, lines and polygon features to be displayed at each level. \nThis information was drawn from the CartoCSS MSS files for the OSM humanitarian theme. The features displayed \nat each level draw their symbology from the stylesheet created based on the Nori and Maki icons, designed to \nlook as similiar to the OSM humanitarian symbols as possible.\n\n\nNote:\n \nThere are currently no labels included in the template as the speed that the layers take to \ndisplay is currently being tested. In future, country and captial city labels may be included but more \ndetailed labelling such as rivers and roads will probably not be added. The information for the labelling, \nsuch as feature names, is included in the OSM attributes so it is possible to create labels for projects \nindividually in the meanwhile. OSM Humanitarian styled fonts are also available in the stylesheet.\n\n\nThere are also 2 other layer files included; bathymetry and a dissolved land polygon based on the OSM data.
