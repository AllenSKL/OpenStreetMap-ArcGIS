##Introduction

This repository provides a means to style OpenStreetMap data imported into ArcGIS using the [OpenStreetMap Editor for ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/extensions/openstreetmap).

The stylesheet and layers included in the repository have been designed to simplify the process of symbolising and displaying OSM data.

3. Display levels 13-15
4. Display levels 16-19

Each layer file contains the
