##OpenStreetMap for ArcGIS
![OSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GASCUK/OpenStreetMap-ArcGIS/master/Images/osm_banner_small.png)

This repository provides a means to style OpenStreetMap data imported into ArcGIS using the 
[OpenStreetMap Editor for ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/extensions/openstreetmap).

The stylesheet and layers included in the repository have been designed to simplify the process of 
symbolising and displaying OSM data. The style design is based on the 
[OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) humanitarian theme. The original style information can be 
found at [HDM-CartoCSS](https://github.com/hotosm/HDM-CartoCSS) and is derived from 
[CartoCSS](https://github.com/mapbox/carto).
