##Models
Some useful models designed to speed up and simplify the method of processing OpenStreetMap data before displaying it in ArcMap, contained within a toolbox.

####Includes:
* **Add OSM Attribute Indexes:** A model designed to add attribute indexes for the OSM point, line and polygon feature classes. The tool only adds the attribute indexes that are specficially required for that feature class, allowing ArcGIS to quickly locate and match an attribute query, speeding up the display of the data within ArcMap.
