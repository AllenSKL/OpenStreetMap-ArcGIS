##Style information

The style file has been built using ArcGIS for Desktop 10.1 and includes all the style information needed to display OSM data within the ArcGIS software in the style of the humanitarian OSM layer.

Further updates will be added as the project progresses. Icons will be added to the style file for attributes not currently displayed on the humanitarian OSM.
